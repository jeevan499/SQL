## üìò Overview

In MySQL, SQL commands are grouped into categories based on their functionality. Understanding these command types is essential for efficient database interaction and management. There are **five main categories** of SQL statements:

- DDL (Data Definition Language)
- DML (Data Manipulation Language)
- DQL (Data Query Language)
- DCL (Data Control Language)
- TCL (Transaction Control Language)

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ DDL ‚Äì Data Definition Language

DDL commands are used to **define or modify the structure of a database** such as tables, schemas, or indexes.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `CREATE` | Creates a new database object such as a table or view. |
| `ALTER` | Modifies an existing database object (e.g., add/remove columns). |
| `DROP` | Deletes objects like tables or databases. |
| `TRUNCATE` | Removes all records from a table, resetting auto-increment values. |
| `RENAME` | Changes the name of a table or database object. |

‚úÖ *DDL commands are auto-committed ‚Äì changes are permanent immediately.*

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ DML ‚Äì Data Manipulation Language

DML commands are used to **manipulate data within tables**.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `INSERT` | Adds new records to a table. |
| `UPDATE` | Modifies existing records in a table. |
| `DELETE` | Removes records from a table. |

‚úÖ *DML operations can be rolled back (used with transactions).*

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ DQL ‚Äì Data Query Language

DQL is used to **fetch data** from a database.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `SELECT` | Retrieves records from one or more tables. |

üîç *This is the most used command to query databases and retrieve information.*

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ DCL ‚Äì Data Control Language

DCL commands are used to **control access to data** in the database.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `GRANT` | Provides user access privileges. |
| `REVOKE` | Removes user access privileges. |

üîê *Useful for managing database security.*

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ TCL ‚Äì Transaction Control Language

TCL commands are used to **manage transactions** in the database to maintain data integrity.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `COMMIT` | Saves all changes made during the transaction. |
| `ROLLBACK` | Undoes changes if there is an error. |
| `SAVEPOINT` | Sets a point within a transaction to roll back to. |
| `SET TRANSACTION` | Sets properties for a transaction. |

üîÅ *TCL is mainly used with DML operations to ensure data consistency.*

## üß© Summary Table

| Command Type | Primary Use | Key Commands |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| DDL | Define or modify schema | CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE |
| DML | Manage table data | INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE |
| DQL | Retrieve data | SELECT |
| DCL | Access control | GRANT, REVOKE |
| TCL | Manage transactions | COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT |
